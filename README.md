# odin-recipes
This is the first full lesson from the Odin project to create a basic list 
of recipes and their contents.  Skills demonstrated will include anchor 
tagging and the placing of images as well as ordered and unordered lists 
and a variety of text manipulations (header, emphatic, strong, etc).
